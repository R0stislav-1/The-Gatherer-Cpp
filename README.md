# The-Gatherer-Cpp
This is the first version of The Gatherer ([https://github.com/Riczap/The-Gatherer](https://github.com/Riczap/The-Gatherer)) rewritten in C++ . I still have to clean the code and create header files for readability, the next step is to add an actual GUI using ImGui.

Remember to include OpenCV to the project, you can follow this tutorial if you need to: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unSce_GPwto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unSce_GPwto). 
**Important:** Use ***opencv_world460.lib*** for the release version.

You can also check the *controls.txt* file to check the temporal keybinds to activate or deactivate functions.
